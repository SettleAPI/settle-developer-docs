## Questions and advice
We use the popular programming Q&A website [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/settle-api) to field technical questions. The site is not run by Settle, but you can ...

Stack Overflow contains questions on a variety of topics, and developers use the tag [`[settle-api]`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/settle-api) to mark questions relevant to this service. You might want to add additional tags to your question to attract the attention of experts in related technologies.

Before posting a new question for the first time, please take a moment to read through the [Stack Overflow Tour](https://stackoverflow.com/tour). The site and its community have guidelines and tips that you should follow to help ensure your question is answered.

## Problems & errors

If you're encountering an error with the API, you should start by searching or posting to Stack Overflow as mentioned above. Try to isolate the problem as much as possible and post only the relevant sections of code.

## Bugs

If after you've tried the above options and you have determined that the cause of a problem is due to a bug in the service itself, you can search our [Issue Tracker]() to determine if it is a known issue. If it is, you can star the issue (click the star next to the issue number) — we prioritize bugs that receive more stars. You can also add comments to existing issues, but you should only do this if you are adding context or additional information about the problem.

If the issue is completely new, you can [report it on our Issue Tracker]() as well. If you do, please ensure you include the following information in your bug description:

- A description of the problem, and the behavior you expected instead.
- A list of steps and a small snippet of sample code that can be used to reproduce the problem.
- A description of the output you expect and what actually occurred. Include any error messages you receive.
- Information about your development environment, including programming language, library versions, etc.

Be aware that issues may be relatively quiet for a while. This does not mean we will never fix an issue; it just means that there are currently no updates.

## Missing features

If there is a feature or functionality missing that you would like to use, you can [search our Issue Tracker]() to determine if others have requested it. If it has already been requested, please star the issue (click the star next to the issue number) — we prioritize bugs that receive more stars. You can also add comments to existing issues, but you should only do this if you are adding context or additional information about the problem.

If the feature hasn't been requested yet, you can [file a feature request on our Issue Tracker](). Please describe the specific functionality you would like to see added, as well as reasons you think it's important. If possible, include specific details about your use case and the new opportunities the feature would allow for.
